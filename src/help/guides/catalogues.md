# Catalogues
This category of features under the catalog page in the app allows you to change what is seen on the page.

### Sources
These are separated by the language they publish in and ordered alphabetically.
### Browse
This button allows you to enter the source with a search button and other search features such as genre filtering and sort order. It sorts by the default order that the source sets.
### Latest
This button allows you to enter the source and see the latest entries from that source without any search features.

###Searching globally
The top right magnifying glass icon can be tapped to search every enabled source.
